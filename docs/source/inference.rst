Inference
=========

After you learned the structure and parameters of the BBN, then you can use `Py-BBN <https://py-bbn.readthedocs.io/>`_ to perform inference. First, you have to create an instance of a BBN, and then use that BBN instance to create an instance of a Junction Tree (JT). Py-BBN is opened source may be installed on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/pybbn/>`_. This library already lists Py-BBN as a requirement, and by installing this library, you will also install Py-BBN.
