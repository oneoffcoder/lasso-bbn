Quickstart
==========

Here is a quickstart example. There are basically 4 steps you will need to make.

#. Read in your data into a Pandas Data Frame.
#. Learn the structure and parameters from the data using the Pandas Data Frame.
#. Convert the structure and parameters into a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN).
#. Convert the BBN into a Join Tree (JT) for exact inference.
